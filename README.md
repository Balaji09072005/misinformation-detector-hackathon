# AI Misinformation Detector

**A prototype built for the GenAI Exchange Hackathon.**

This project is an AI-powered tool that helps users detect potential misinformation in online articles by scraping the content and analyzing it for manipulative language and tone.

## üöÄ The Problem

The rapid spread of fake news and misinformation across social media in India poses a severe threat, leading to social unrest, public health crises, and financial scams. This project aims to provide users with an accessible tool to critically evaluate the content they consume.

## ‚ú® Our Solution

Our web application allows a user to paste a URL of a news article. The backend, built with Python and Flask, scrapes the article's content. This content is then analyzed for markers of misinformation (using a smart simulation). The final report, including a tone analysis, is displayed to the user on a clean, modern interface.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

* **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
* **Backend:** Python, Flask
* **AI:** Dynamic Simulation of a Generative AI Model's output
* **Deployment:** The frontend is deployed on Netlify.
